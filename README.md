# zoom_clone #

Greetings to the Readers !
I have created website to deliver a platform to the user in which one can easily communicate and interact with larger groups all around. Specifically its a replica similar to zoom
and other similar applications. <br/>
Where individulas can talk on video call, share content, hold meetings, classes or can simply chat. <br/>
Using these basic features can bring about tremendous beneficial aspects: <br/>
* HEALTH SECTOR <br/> 
* EDUCATIONAL SECTOR (especially for students) <br/>
* PROFESSIONAL SECTOR
You have to give permission to your camera and microphone when using this app for the first time.
